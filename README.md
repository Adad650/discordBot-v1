Made a bot that tells the time on discord with using /time.

Insert your bot token into a new file called mySecrets.env

Future Plans

Bot functionality:
* /weather: Integrate this with the weather app
* /gpt: Pass forward the chat message to gpt

Skill:
* Send images from bot->server

Cleaning up / Mantaining code:
* Add ability to add lots of more slash commands and keep code clean. (on_message can send request further down to slash-command-specific functions)
